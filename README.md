# **UFOs**

## ***Overview:***

The main goal of this project is to build a user-friendly website that will allow the readers to 
search UFO sightings. 

## ***Results:***

The website has a header of a nice earth pictue with the title. Under that is a small introduction article about UFOs.

Under that we added a table with filter options on the left side. The table can be filtered by date, city, state, country and shape.

Viewers can enter their search criteria in on or more of the filter boxes in order to show the specific sightings that they're interested in. 

## ***Summary:***

The web page that we created is very informative, simple and user friendly. The filters allow the viewers to find the sightings they're looking for very easily.
